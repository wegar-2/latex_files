# latex_files
Container for tex and pdf files with my writings. There is not much in here for the time being (written as of 2021-07-17).
The contents of this folder are intended to serve as a future reference for my own use, so that
I can access the information that I might need from any device I might be working on.

I have no pretense of these texts being journal level articles since this is not their purpose, as explained above.

## Contents
Currently the contents are stored in the following folders:
1. *probability_calculus* - folder for storing all things that are mostly related to probability.
2. *time_series_analysis* - folder for storing notes on ARMA, GARCH class of processes, esp. on the estimation of model parameters.
